#Prediction Assignment
Here, we apply the machine learning algorithm we built above, to each of the 20 test cases in the testing data set provided.
answers <- predict(model, cleanTestingdata)
answers <- as.character(answers)
answers

##  [1] "B" "A" "B" "A" "A" "E" "D" "B" "A" "A" "B" "C" "B" "A" "E" "E" "A" "B" "B" "B"


Finally, we write the answers to files as specified by the course instructor using the following code segment.
pml_write_files = function(x) {
    n = length(x)
    for (i in 1:n) {
        filename = paste0("problem_id_", i, ".txt")
        write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, 
            col.names = FALSE)
    }
}

pml_write_files(answers)
On submission, we would see that all the predicted values are correct and a score of 20\20 is obtained. 


#Conclusion
We chose Random Forest as our machine learning algorithm for building our model because,
Builds a highly accurate classifier.
Can handle thousands of variables.
Balances bias and variance trade-offs by settling for a balanced model.
Using k-fold cross validation builds a robust model.
We also obtained a really good accuracy based on the statistics we obtained above.
